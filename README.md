# ObjectiveLnk
API to create Objective link file from URL

This is designed to be run on IIS and simply returns the final part of the URL as the content of a .obr file with the same name.  The user can download and then open the file to jump to that location in Objective.

# Example URL
http://len0013858.corp.rta.nsw.gov.au/ObjectiveLink/api/Obr/fA5642034
